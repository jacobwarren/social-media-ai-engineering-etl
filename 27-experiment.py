I would learn git to revert mistakes, focus on finishing projects by starting small, and improve communication with my team on code and designs. But above all, I would choose to start learning now. Learn git to revert mistakes by reading Pro Git, Atlassian Git, and starting a GitHub. Focus on finishing projects by building front-end, front-end/backend, and full-stack apps. Improve communication by taking public speaking courses, learning to present, and empathizing with the audience. The above is a small list of how I wish I could learn how to code again. But if I had to choose one thing above anything else, I would choose to start learning now.

I believe that working on real-world DevOps projects is essential for both entry-level and advanced-level DevOps engineers to gain practical experience and stand out in job interviews. Doing these projects will give you the implementation knowledge needed to impress recruiters and measure up with someone with 3 years of experience. Certifications alone are not enough; you need to have worked on production-related projects to secure a job over other candidates. I also teach how to document projects using GitHub, which is a valuable skill for any DevOps engineer. I have 26 real-time projects that will provide 3 years of work experience, broaden knowledge, and prepare DevOps engineers for jobs. Recruiters seek candidates with production-related projects, not just certifications. I teach GitHub markdown and project documentation. These projects help stand out in interviews and match the experience of a 3-year veteran. Send a message if interested.

Sometimes a channel just doesn't work, and it was hard for me to accept that Google Ads, which I relied on for capturing existing demand, wasn't converting qualified leads into sales despite high CTRs and conversion rates. After months of burning through budget with little return, I had to shut it down and learn not to be too attached to any one channel or strategy, always ready to cut losses if the important signals indicate it's not working. Google Ads was my go-to for capturing existing demand. CTRs were well above 4%, conversion rates were sometimes higher than CTRs, and most leads were sales qualified. Over 6 months, the campaign burned through budget with very little to show for it. So, we turned it off.

I find that the key to building a successful digital business is using my brand to tell a unique story that no one else can tell. By identifying a problem, solving it, sharing my solution, and then packaging it to sell, I position myself as a creator-of-one, eliminating competition and standing out in the creator economy. Most people can see a problem, but only a small percentage actually solve it, share their solution, and monetize it, making those who do part of the top 1% of creators.

I find that when I answer questions at work without addressing the deeper concerns, people start doubting my competence. To improve responses, I focus on the 'question behind the question,' ensuring I provide a thorough and reassuring answer that addresses their underlying concerns. This approach prevents repetitive questioning, skepticism, and the need for endless back-and-forth, saving time and emotional labor. By understanding what the person truly values and cares about, I can tailor my response to make them feel reassured and safe, even if they don't know exactly what they're asking. Improving your communication skills are just one of the topics we cover in the Maven Course Accelerator. It's a 2-week program on how to teach an engaging, live course. It's free.
